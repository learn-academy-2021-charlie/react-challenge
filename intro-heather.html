            <h1>Playing around with React</h1>
            <h2>Multiple Outputs</h2>
            <p> Still trying to understand this blending between JavaScript and HTML. It is helpful to practice. JSX is a language that is very similar to HTML. In order for this to render on the page it needs to be within a class that is extending a react component. Next a component function is created so it can tell react where this needs to be showing. In our case the react-container div. Then this class is gets called by using the function render with the class your calling and the div location you want it to render in.</p>

            <Greeting />
            // This is a component call! It is calling on the greeting class making it set into motion.

            </>
          )
        }
      }

      class Greeting extends React.Component{
        render(){
          return(
          <>
          // React fragments that help to create containers necessary.
            <h2>Hello, here is more React</h2>
            <p> However we are doing nested components now!</p>
            </>
            // This is not showing yet because we have not called on this class. If you want it to get rendered then call it in the parent class..
          )

        }
      }
      const domContainer = document.querySelector('#react-container');
      ReactDOM.render(<HelloReact />, domContainer);
